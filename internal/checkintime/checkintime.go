/*
	Design note
	-----------

	We cannot store on disk the monotonic clock readings because we are
	only allowed to serialize time.Time as a string representing a "wall
	clock" time. Also, the monotonic clock is system dependent and may
	not refer to a well defined zero time. For example, on Windows, the
	monotonic clock uses the "interrupt time", which countes the time since
	boot in 100ns intervals, so serializing it is not a good idea.

	See https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.20.2:src/runtime/time_windows_amd64.s
	See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/interrupt-time
	See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/system-time

	Storing wall clocks on disk could be done in UTC to account for the
	user jumping across timezones. Still, even if we did that, the stored
	reading would still be wrong when there are wall clock adjusments, which
	includes adjusting the system clock using NTP et al. (There are cases
	in which the clock adjustment is a jump and cases in which it is relatively
	monotonic; see https://man.openbsd.org/settimeofday#CAVEATS as well as
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/system-time.)

	Therefore, the implementation of this package works entirely on memory
	and requires calling the check-in API before performing any other
	operation that requires timing.

	This design choice is ~fine since we're moving towards a direction
	where the check-in API will be called before running tests. Yet,
	it also means that we wouldn't be able to verify the probe clock when
	using a cached check-in response in the future.

	A possible future improvement would be for this package to export a
	"best effort" clock using either the system clock or the API clock
	to provide time.Time values to TLS and QUIC. The choice on which
	clock to use would depend on the measured clocks offset. This would
	theoretically allow us to make TLS handshakes work even when the
	probe clock is singificantly off. However, it's also true that we
	would like to make TLS handshake verification non-fatal, because it
	helps us to collect more data. Because of this reason, I have not
	implemented subverting the TLS verification reference clock.
