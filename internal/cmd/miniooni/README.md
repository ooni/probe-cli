# miniooni

This directory contains the source code of a simple CLI client that we
use for research as well as for running QA scripts. We designed this tool
to have a CLI similar to MK and OONI Probe v2.x to ease running Jafar
scripts that check whether these tools behave similarly. Perfect backwards
compatibility was not a design goal for miniooni. Rather, we aimed to
have as little conflict as possible, such that we can run side-by-side
QA checks.
