# Tutorial: using the dslx API for writing OONI experiments

Welcome to the tutorial for writing OONI network tests using dslx!

We introduced dslx with the idea to make writing OONI experiments easier than previous
strategies for writing experiments (see [the dslx design
document](../../../docs/design/dd-005-dslx.md) for more information on our reasoning).

## Index

- [chapter01](chapter01) shows you the general principle of dslx based on some examples.

- [chapter02](chapter02) is the main part of this tutorial. You will learn how to re-implement
an existing OONI Probe experiment (SNI blocking) using dslx.

- [chapter03](chapter03) shows you how to run dslx measurements in parallel.

If you encounter problems with using dslx or this tutorial, please let us know. We appreciate
any feedback to make dslx as community-friendly as possible.
