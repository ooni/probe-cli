	   TODO(bassosimone): Debateable result for v0.4, while v0.5 behaves in the
	   correct way. See <https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/issues/579>.

	   Some historical context follows:

	   Note that MK is not doing it right here because it's suppressing the
	   dns_nxdomain_error that instead is very informative. Yet, it is reporting
	   a failure in HTTP, which miniooni does not because it does not make
	   sense to perform HTTP when there are no IP addresses.

	   The following seems indeed a bug in MK where we don't properly record the
	   actual error that occurred when performing the DNS experiment.

	   See <https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit/issues/1931>.
