//
// We eventually managed to link such a change with the 0.3.4 release of
// Measurement Kit <https://git.io/JJHOS>. This led us to find out the
// related issue #867 <https://git.io/JJHOH>. From this issue it become
// clear that the change on Measurement Kit was applied to mirror a change
// implemented in OONI Probe Legacy <https://git.io/JJH3T>. In such a
// change, determine_blocking() was modified to return False in case no
// blocking was detected, to distinguish this case from the case where
// there was an early failure in the experiment.
//
// Indeed, the OONI Android app uses the case where `blocking` is `null`
// to flag failed tests. Instead, success is identified by `blocking` being
// false and all other cases indicate anomaly <https://git.io/JJH3C>.
//
// Because of that, we must preserve the original behaviour.
